## Progression Rules

1. **Rep Progression**: When you hit 8 reps with good form, add weight next session.
2. **Weight Jumps**: Increase by smallest increment available (2.5kg dumbbells, 5kg barbell).
3. **Deload**: If you miss reps 2 sessions in a row, reduce weight 10% and rebuild.
4. **Failure**: Push to 1-2 reps from failure (RIR 1-2). Don't train to absolute failure every set.

## Daily Walking Target

**Goal:** 10,000 steps  
**Pace:** Slow. "Like you have nowhere to be."  
**When:** Throughout the day (morning walk, lunch walk, evening stroll)
