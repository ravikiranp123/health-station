# User Profile: Sample User

## Stats

- **DOB**: 1993-08-22
- **Height**: 175 cm
- **Sex**: Male
- **Physique**: Skinny Fat (Targeting General Hypertrophy & Toning)

## Goals

- **Current Goal**: Lazy Aesthetic Recomp (V-Taper Focus)
- **Training Philosophy**: Minimalist (2-3x/week, high intensity, long rest)
- **Protein Target**: ~70g/day (The "Bricks"). Anchor nutrient.
- **Fueling Strategy (The "Why"):**
  - **Fats (The Managers)**: ~50-60g/day. Critical for Testosterone & brain. *Never* drop below 40g.
  - **Carbs (The Workers)**: Variable. High on training days (Roti/Rice). Fuel for workout intensity.
  - **Goal**: "Recomp" = High Protein + Enough Energy to train hard, but clean sources. Using snacks to fill deficits is "Dirty Recomp" (Effective but unhealthy).
  - **Sustainability Principle**: Adherence > Perfection. If a sub-optimal choice (like Chikki) prevents a full system crash/binge, it is the *optimal* choice for that moment.

## Current Stack (Hacker Audit)

- **Joint Support Formula**: *Excellent.* Glucosamine + MSM + Vitamin D. Addresses joint stiffness (Glucosamine) + Inflammation (MSM) + Bone health (Vit D). Take with breakfast.
- **Omega Complex**: *Verified.* Fish Oil + Turmeric Extract. Top-tier "Joint & Inflammation" support.
- **Collagen Peptides**: *Essential.* Supports connective tissue. Critical for the joint stiffness condition.
- **Cod Liver Oil**: *Supplemental.* Check EPA/DHA levels. Good for Vitamin A and joint mobility.
- **Ashwagandha**: *Cycle It.* 300-500mg. Controls cortisol (Belly Fat). Cycle: 3 weeks ON, 1 week OFF.
- **Creatine**: *Non-negotiable.* Hydrates muscle cells. Supports training intensity.
- **Triphala + Isabgol**: *Gut Health.* Keep it.
- **Vitamin D3+K2+B12 Combo**: *Rescue Protocol*. User reports joint pain increase when off D3.
  - *Action*: Take consistently 2-3 times/week to maintain baseline, preventing flare-ups.

## Inventory (Not Consuming / Experimental)

- **Boswellia Extract**: *Anti-Inflammatory Protocol*
  - *Benefit*: Reduces joint inflammation naturally.
  - *Side Effect*: Mild stomach upset if taken on empty stomach.
  - *Protocol*: **With Meals + Turmeric** confirmed effective.
    - **Timing**: With largest meal of the day.
    - **Buffer**: Stack with **Black Pepper** to enhance curcumin absorption.
    - *Residual*: None when taken with food. **Well-tolerated**.
- **Hyaluronic Acid (Oral)**: Backup for joint lubrication.

## Topical & Mobility Protocols

### **The Joint Recovery Protocol**

- **Maintenance (Daily)**: **Gentle Mobility Work**.
  - *Use Case*: Joints feel stiff but mobile. Daily maintenance.
  - *Method*: Cat-cow stretches, joint rotations, slow walking.
- **Flare-Up Mode**: **Ice + Compression**.
  - *Use Case*: Joint is **inflamed**, swollen, or painful after activity.
  - *Why*: Need immediate inflammation control. Long-term mobility work comes after acute phase.
  - *Transition*: Switch back to gentle mobility once swelling reduces (2-3 days).
- **Prevention**: Foam rolling + dynamic warmups before training.

### **The Flexibility Protocol**

- **Active Recovery**: **Yoga + Stretching Routine**.
  - *Best Use*: On rest days. Improves range of motion.
- **Consistency**: **10-15 min daily** stretching routine. Critical for long-term joint health.

## Bio-Hacks & Protocols

- **The "Mobility First" Protocol**:
  1. **Warmup**: 5-10 min joint rotations before any workout.
  2. **Load**: Only load joints that are warmed up and pain-free.
  3. **Why**: Prevent injury by respecting pain signals.
- **Pre-Workout**: Glucosamine + MSM stack (taken 30-60 min before training for joint protection).

## Cart Audit (Buy vs Drop)

- **Vitamin C**: **KEEP.** Works synergistically with collagen production.
- **Standalone Glucosamine**: **DROP.**
  - *Why*: Already getting from Joint Support Formula. Avoid duplicate dosing.
- **B-Complex**: **DROP if redundant.**
  - *Why*: Already getting B12 from D3 combo. Don't overdose B vitamins.
- **Multi-Vitamin**: **DROP if redundant.**
  - *Why*: Check for overlap with existing stack. Avoid duplicate minerals.

## Future Optimization Strategy (The "Hacker" Logic)

**Rule**: "Hack" simple molecules. "Stack" complex ones.

| Item              | Strategy            | Why?                                                                   |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Glucosamine**   | **Buy Smart Combo** | Get MSM/Vit D for free with Glucosamine.                               |
| **Turmeric**      | **Buy Brand**       | Need standardized curcumin %. Generic varies wildly.                   |
| **Vitamin C**     | **Pharma Hack**     | Vitamin C is a commodity. Generic pharma >> Fancy Brands.              |
| **Collagen**      | **Raw Hack**        | Flavored "beauty" branded versions are expensive. Buy unflavored bulk. |
| **Fish Oil**      | **Quality Matters** | Oxidized fish oil is harmful. Buy refrigerated/quality brand.          |

## Precise Protocol Adjustments

- **Ashwagandha Timing**: **Night / Post-Dinner**.
  - *Why*: It lowers cortisol. Taking it at night aligns with natural wind-down and improves sleep quality.
- **Collagen Selection**: **Hydrolyzed Collagen (Unflavored)**.
  - *Why*: Better absorption. Mix with coffee/smoothies.

## Supplement Timing Logic

- **Joint Support Combo**: **Morning with breakfast**.
  - *Result*: **Better mobility throughout the day**. Glucosamine + MSM synergy confirmed.
  - *Note*: Taking with food prevents stomach upset.
