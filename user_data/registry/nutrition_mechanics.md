# HealthOS Nutrition Mechanics

## 1. Protein "Partialisation" (Nutrient Partitioning)
**Concept:** When you eat protein (e.g., Dal), your body breaks it down into "Amino Acids" (building blocks).
*   **The Problem:** Muscle building requires **Complete Proteins** (all 9 essential amino acids).
*   **Incomplete Sources (Dal/Peanuts):** They are missing keys (like Methionine). If you eat *only* Dal, your body cannot completely utilize it for muscle tissue. It uses what it can and converts the rest to glucose/fat.
*   **The Fix:** Pairing. Dal + Rice = Complete Protein.
*   **Why Animal/Dairy is Superior:** Eggs/Paneer/Whey are "Complete" by default. 100% of it is usable for muscle repair immediately. The term "Partialisation" was a simplification for **Bio-availability** and **Amino Acid Profiling**.

## 2. The "Fog" (Systemic Inflammation)
**Concept:** Your brain is 60% fat. It relies on lipid stability.
*   **The Villain (Refined Seed Oils):** Sunflower/Soybean oils are high in **Omega-6** fatty acids.
*   **The Mechanism:** Omega-6 is pro-inflammatory. When consumed in excess (deep fried snacks), it triggers an immune response (Cytokines).
*   **The Sensation:** This low-grade inflammation crosses the blood-brain barrier, causing "Neuro-inflammation".
    *   *Symptoms:* Sluggish thinking, difficulty focusing, "waking up tired", and low drive.
    *   *Why you missed it:* It's chronic. You might think feeling "okay" is normal, until you cut them out and feel "sharp".

## 3. The "Crash" (Reactive Hypoglycemia)
**Concept:** Energy stability is Blood Sugar stability.
*   **The Mechanism:**
    1.  Eat Sugar/Maida (Simple Carbs).
    2.  Blood Sugar spikes rapidly (Energy Burst!).
    3.  Pancreas panics and dumps **Insulin**.
    4.  Insulin shuttles sugar out of blood *too fast*.
    5.  Blood Sugar drops BELOW baseline.
*   **The Crash:** That drop triggers adrenaline/cortisol (Panic hormones). You feel shaky, irritable, and sleepy immediately after lunch.
*   **The Fix:** Fiber & Fat (Roti/Ghee) slows digestion, creating a gentle wave instead of a spike.

## 4. Decision: Ghee vs. Refined Oil
**Verdict: PERMANENTLY REPLACE REFINED OIL WITH GHEE.**
*   **Stability:** Ghee is a Saturated Fat. It is stable at high heat. It does not oxidize (rot) inside your body.
*   **Hormones:** Cholesterol in Ghee is the precursor to Testosterone.
*   **Gut:** Ghee contains Butyrate, which heals the gut lining.
*   **Refined Oil:** Is chemically extracted (Hexane), bleached, and deodorized. It is industrial lubricant. Get it out of your kitchen.

## 5. The Protein Ratio Flip (Lazy Aesthetic)
**Concept:** Flip the traditional plate composition.
*   **Old Way:** Carbs (Rice/Roti) = Main Dish. Protein (Dal/Sabzi) = Side.
*   **New Way:** Protein (Eggs/Paneer/Soya) = Main Dish. Carbs = Side.
*   **Practical:** Serve yourself the protein FIRST (2/3 of plate), then fill gaps with carbs.
*   **Why:** Protein triggers satiety hormones (PYY, GLP-1). You'll eat less overall and feel fuller.

## 6. Eggetarian Volume Strategy
**Concept:** Non-meat protein sources are less calorically dense.
*   **The Problem:** 100g Chicken = ~31g protein. 100g Paneer = ~18g protein. You need MORE volume.
*   **The Solution:** 3 meals/day (not 2). Spread protein targets across breakfast, lunch, dinner.
*   **Example Day:**
    | Meal | Source | Protein |
    |------|--------|--------|
    | Breakfast | 3 Eggs + Milk | ~22g |
    | Lunch | 100g Paneer + Soya Keema | ~25g |
    | Dinner | 3 Eggs + Whey | ~28g |
    | **Total** | | **~75g** |

## 7. Single-Ingredient Foods
**Concept:** Reduce decision fatigue. Stock the kitchen with simple, high-protein staples.
*   **Eggs:** The ultimate. Complete protein. Cheap.
*   **Paneer (Milky Mist High Protein):** Scrambled for best texture.
*   **Soya Granules (Nutrela):** Pressure-cooked. Batch prep.
*   **Greek Yogurt:** High protein, probiotic, snack or dessert.
*   **Whey Protein:** Gap filler. Not primary.
*   **Chana (Roasted):** Snack. Protein + Fiber. Replaces chips.
