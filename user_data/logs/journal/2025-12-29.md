## Notes

* **Paneer Bhurji Fix:** Next time add: 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp red chili powder, piri piri masala (NO garam masala - causes acidity). Salt was added. Milk helped soften the low-fat paneer.
* **Plank:** Target 45s next session. Build up 5s each week.
* **Left Side Weakness:** Mudgar Press difficult on left hand. Struggled to control the lowering (eccentric) phase. Pushups also felt hard. → Indicates left shoulder stabilizers are weaker than right. Needs unilateral focus.
