# Feedback Loops & Learned Patterns

## What Works (The Winners)
- **Eggs (v4):** Morning Masala Bhurji. *Key:* 2 tbsp Milk for fluffiness, No Jeera powder.
- **Soya (v3):** One-Shot Pressure Cooker Keema. *Key:* Pressure cooking solves raw peas. Squeezing granules dry removes raw smell.
- **Paneer (v2):** Piri Piri Bhurji. *Key:* Milk hack rehydrates high-protein paneer. Crumbling > Cubing.
- **Snacks (v3):** Masala Roasted Chana (Shrego/Jabsons).

## What Failed (Do Not Repeat)
- **Egg Versions:**
  - v2 (White Bhurji with Whole Jeera) -> Disliked Texture.
  - v3 (Malai Masala) -> Good but lacked volume for breakfast.
- **Soya Versions:**
  - v1 (Chunks Curry) -> Bland center.
  - v2 (Pan Fry Granules) -> Hard peas, time consuming.
- **Paneer Versions:**
  - v1 (Cubes) -> Rubbery texture.
- **Snack Versions:**
  - v1 (Crax Namkeen) -> Palm Oil.
  - v2 (Thick Chana Jor) -> Bland.
- **Late Night Spice:** Fried onions/tomatoes/red chilli at night = Acidity.

## Learning Gaps (To Solve)
- Consistency/Willpower (struggles with friction).
- Advanced Mudgar flows (10-to-2).
- Identifying hidden UPF/Oils in 'healthy' snacks.
